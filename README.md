## TODO
- [ ] when moving note with new system and is holding at top/bottom - scroll up/down automatically - cursor must be moving otherwise it stops
- [ ] optional log file of actions with ability to upload to server
- [ ] (happens only sometimes) new note -> save & go back -> move new note -> refresh notes -> the note that should have been first is moved (maybe to its original position based on creation date - not sure at all)
- [ ] (happens only sometimes) new note with title and no content -> save & go back -> refresh notes -> false positive changes found
- [ ] closable alert cant be closed by clicking horizontally next to it (diagonally or vertically works)
- [ ] site css & js fix - a lot of useless properties, messy code, slideshow can only be once on site, problem if height too low etc etc
- [ ] dragdown to refresh and dragup to navigate -> false positive when moving note with new system
- [ ] dragdown to refresh and dragup to navigate -> probably false positive when scrolling up and down on phone (not tested)
- [ ] dragdown to refresh and dragup to navigate -> if no notes, make sure the text widget takes the whole screen so dragging works
- [ ] unify capital letters, alert buttons, code style, fonts etc
- [ ] change package name when debugging so it does not replace original like add _dev and for google play remove it?
- [ ] bug: on smaller logical ppi settings custom api and scale put on separate lines or smth
- [ ] floating action button - right now i use padding 70px to make sure it is not over some text, find a better way
- [ ] Navigator.push() -> Navigator.pushReplacement() ?? will back button on android still work? (right now we end up with multiple instances over each other - not documented probably) (https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation)
- [ ] `onPressed: ()` etc can be async e.g. msgs pop ups, might be easier than `.then()` I surely used many times and is not blocking UI
- [ ] reset notes order button: set all last/next keys to null and first element to null, should force order by creation date
- [ ] rename package to tech.kardi.notes
- [ ] smooth edges of content text field in the editor page
- [ ] on server check for ownerKey in each request or mby send it just one and save in session (new session when changing owner key)
- [ ] server insert sql if unique fail (right now just errors out the result)
- [ ] if session not found init new one so possible changed content is not lost and dont have to restart the app
- [ ] find text in note
- [ ] upload to app stores
- [ ] post quantum encryption
- [ ] option to participate in beta features
- [ ] study flutter decompilation & obfuscation
- [ ] when green alert is shown, and new one should be shown, dont wait for the old one to finish but stack them vertically on each other
- [ ] scale of notes on main page and scale of text (and images or whatever)
- [ ] green comments
- [ ] stats (how many notes, total amount of words in all notes) ??
- [ ] script or something to purge sessions and requests from database periodically
- [ ] too many api fails from ip -> timeout
- [ ] initSession() add request_id cuz could spam api? maybe?
- [ ] text not all the way down (buttons are over it - maybe?)
- [ ] blur all option + individual option (when all on -> all individuals on but can turn off individual)
- [ ] offline mode (if changing note offline, save hash of the unedited version (last online version) and when back online check for mismatch (old online version + our offline) but idk when, maybe on startup, maybe when accessing note, maybe when saving the note)
- [ ] blur linking devices owner key with unhide toggle button
- [ ] maintenance mode
- [ ] option to wipe all data from server automatically
- [ ] automatically fetch new notes in the background with option to disable
- [ ] toggle animations option
- [ ] error checking version sometimes (update 2024: still?? maybe not)
- [ ] new owner key -> has messages -> opens message -> goes back using android back button, not the icon back button in app -> still shows unread messages on messages page button (does not update ui)
- [ ] dev web page to view feedback and send messages
- [ ] last access time, last edit time ??
- [ ] allow back button on phone, definitely pop context before changing to new page cuz memory leak or just too many opened after some time?
- [ ] test delete note and then on other device edit the deleted note or smth
- [ ] test open app, delete session and what happens?
- [ ] password on startup that is used to encrypt owner key (if somebody stole the phone and knew what he was looking for, this would prevent him from decrypting notes)
- [ ] qr to transfer owner key (buttons: show qr and scan on other device to import there, show qr and scan on other device to import here (for pc), scan qr)
- [ ] mby dont call setState inside of @override initState? e.g. editor_page.dart
- [ ] probably should check owner key in all requests, rn if user guesses note key, he can e.g. change blur state of other notes he does not own
- [ ] custom button color
- [ ] highlight mismatch alerts with red color
- [ ] color not saved when note not saved yet
- [ ] background checks are a complete mess - false positives, rework completely possibly
- [x] password on notes (new note set locally only if not created on server yet; dont ask for the password for 5 minutes after closing the note; encrypt content with password)

- [x] test cron on phone, set to every minute, open note, close phone, open phone after 5mins, what happens? also maybe leave note app in background but phone open
